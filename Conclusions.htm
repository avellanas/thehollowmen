<b><font size=+2>Conclusions</font></b></h1>
<a href="Poem.htm">"The Hollow
Men"</a> is essentially a poem of emptiness, Eliot's exploration of the
state of his own soul as one of many modern souls suffering the same affliction.&nbsp;
It is an emptiness caused by the condition of the modern world, a modern
world in which men live only for themselves, failing to choose between
good and evil.&nbsp; The souls in the poem whose condition we are supposed
to be horrified by are not those who have sinned the most, but those who
have not chosen whether or not to sin.&nbsp; They exist in a state in-between,
a state in which their failure to make a decision causes an utter lack
of hope and joy or pain.&nbsp; The heroes of this poem are those who clearly
see this state and recognize its true horror.&nbsp; Much of the horror
of this state is constructed through the use of allusions that refer to
past historical and fictitious characters who suffered similar fates, or
who realized the horror of that fate in some decisive moment.&nbsp; While
Eliot's general intent may be clear purely from the words of the poem,
a much richer understanding can only be achieved by understanding the allusions
he uses as literary tools to construct the work on a foundation laid by
authors before him.
<p>Eliot's allusive sources are well chosen, for they bring to mind examples
of souls who suffer from the same moral condition as those in the poem.&nbsp;
All of those souls that are referenced are taken from works or events that
are extremely powerful in their own right.&nbsp; Eliot's use of them adds
considerably to the power that his poem can convey.&nbsp; From <i><a href="Notesonpoem.htm#divinecomedy">The
Divine Comedy</a></i> he takes images of souls at every level of the afterlife:
hell, purgatory, and heaven.&nbsp; Dante's lost souls who never made up
their minds to live their lives for good or evil and thus are denied entrance
to all three suffer the same condition as Eliot's modern man.&nbsp; Dante
the pilgrim becomes heroic in that he dares to look his guilt, shame, and
sin in the eye and then makes the conscious decision to repent.&nbsp; Joseph
Conrad's Kurtz also escapes this danger, because in his death he realizes
the horror of the modern condition, while his Marlow also realizes a bit
of the danger, but still cannot bring himself to tell the truth of it.&nbsp;
Shakespeare's Brutus also realizes the danger of inaction, the fate of
only being able to exist as the shadow, somewhere in-between, but his pride
causes him to choose the weaker route and join the doomed conspiracy.&nbsp;
Guy Fawkes's whimper spells the end of the failed conspiracy with which
he was involved - by doing so he gives up the choice he made for rebellion,
his confession betraying his co-conspirators.
<p>Without these specific examples, Eliot could not have conveyed the same
meanings without spelling everything out letter by letter.&nbsp; In this
poem not only do the allusions display particularly strong examples of
the condition Eliot is conveying, but they also add to the power of the
poem considerably by evoking a sense of history, of being part of something
larger, of being part of a continual decline, or of a constant danger of
the human condition.&nbsp; The whimper with which the world ends is the
whimper of modern man, the whimper of Guy Fawkes giving away other members
of his plot, Brutus betraying his Caesar, Kurtz finally seeing all that
he has created and been a part of for what it is, and the murmur of the
shades who can never enter heaven or hell.&nbsp; When seen in this context
the last words of the poem gain a sort of power they do not have on their
own, as they echo the spirits of other historical and fictitious characters.
<p>Only by discovering the sources of Eliot's allusions can we come to
a complete understanding of the poem, regardless of how well it may appear
to stand on its own.&nbsp; Eliot himself gives very clear clues to at least
two of his allusive sources by direct quotations before the poem proper
even begins: first in the epigraph to the section, taken directly from
<i><a href="Notesonpoem.htm#heartofdarkness">Heart
of Darkness</a></i>, and then in the epigraph to the poem, taken directly
from the children's cry on <a href="http://web.idirect.com/~redsonja/guy/">Guy
Fawkes Day</a>.&nbsp; Clearly these are not meant to be hidden references
and once they are discovered other uses of those sources, and other sources
that touch upon the same themes, can be quickly uncovered and interpreted.
<p>The particular format I make use of allows these discoveries to be made
easily, certainly much more easily than pouring through guides, criticism,
and original texts.&nbsp; Probably the greatest addition to a hypertext
annotation of the poem, as opposed to a regular print annotation, is that
often one can easily access external web sites on that work, allowing the
reader to examine the entire source text, explore other criticism on that
text, other historical information on it, and even bibliographical information
on the author and other works he or she has written.&nbsp; Of course, this
is all dependent on what is publicly available as well as on its quality,
but with increasing frequency one can find numerous places, often officially
affiliated with a college or university, or some other form of professional
scholarship, that are accurate in their information and intuitive in their
use.
<p>Putting together the pieces that make up an allusion (finding the source,
examining it, applying the relevant themes from the source to the newer
work) allow the reader to take some of the power of the poem into his or
her own hands.&nbsp; It is up to that reader to find and determine the
meanings of the poem and apply his or her own learning experience to the
poem.&nbsp; This act of interpretation makes the poem much more personal
to the reader even though initially, the allusions may have the opposite
effect, making the poem seem exclusive in that it is only accessible to
an already knowledgeable reader.&nbsp; In this presentation, I have sought
to make the <a href="Poem.htm">"The Hollow Men"</a> accessible to any reader
willing to be active; this is merely an example of methods and presentations
that can be used with any other allusive work.&nbsp; The hypertext links
allow any active reader to become knowledgeable easily, thus demonstrating
both the power of allusions as a literary tool, and the power of hypertext
as a scholarly tool.&nbsp; The two complement each other in such a way
that each reaches its full potential, making the author's text more widely
readable with all of its intentions intact, and allowing the reader a better
opportunity to study and understand those intentions, an unquestionable
benefit to both.
