Many scholars believe this to be one of Ol\' Possum\'s many false trails, instead believing it comes from a mention of \'<a href=Quotes.htm#JCIVii>hollow men</a>\' in <i>Julius Caesar</i>or any of several references to Joseph Conrad\'s Kurtz as hollow in some way (a \'hollow sham\', \'hollow at the core\'). The title immediately presents us with the first of many allusions, directly referencing two of the four main sources for this poem, Shakespeare\'s <i><a ng-click=\"vm.showNote(\'juliuscaesar\')\">Julius Caesar</a>,</i> and Conrad\'s <i><a ng-click=\"vm.showNote(\'heartofdarkness\')\">Heart of Darkness</a></i> (which I will often abbreviate <i>HoD</i>). The other sources are the <a ng-click=\"vm.showNote(\'gunpowderplot\')\">Gunpowder Plot</a> and <i><a ng-click=\"vm.showNote(\'divinecomedy\')\">The Divine Comedy</a></i>, both of which also deal with men or shadows of men who may be described as hollow at the core.</p></section><section class=note id=gunpowderplot ng-show=\"vm.isVisible(\'gunpowderplot\')\"><h3>Gunpowder Plot</h3><p><a href=http://www.gunpowder-plot.org>This conspiracy</a> arose from the English Catholics\' resentment of King James I and his reign\'s treatment of their religion. A group of extremists led by Rober Catesby planed to seize power by killing King James I and his ministers at the State Opening of Parliament (November 5, 1605), leaving England without a government. Francis Tresham, one of the conspirators, gave the plan away when he wrote to his brother-in-law, Lord Monteagle, telling him to stay away from the Houses of Parliament during the Opening. Monteagle informed the Lord Chancellor of the warning, who in turn told the king. On November 4, 1605, Guy Fawkes was arrested in the cellars of the House of Lords, standing guard over two tons of gunpowder. He was tortured until he revealed the names of his co-conspirators, who, if they hadn\'t yet fled the country, were soon executed. Now the British celebrate November 5 with bonfires, fireworks, and by burning effigies of Guy. Theoretically, they are celebrating the execution of a traitor, though some have been been known to see it as a celebration of the near death of the monarchy.</p></section><section class=note id=juliuscaesar ng-show=\"vm.isVisible(\'juliuscaesar\')\"><h3><i>Julius Caesar</i></h3><p><a href=http://tech-two.mit.edu/Shakespeare/julius_caesar/index.html>Shakespeare\'s version</a> of the <a href=http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/caesar.html>story of Julius Caesar</a> also centers around a violent conspiracy of men who are blinded by their cause. In it, Brutus, a leading Roman citizen, is approached by Cassius, who is recruiting people to conspire to assassinate Caesar. Cassius is motivated by ambition, envy, and malice, and he persuades Brutus that Caesar is a tyrant who will destroy the Roman Republic. Cassius plays on Brutus\'s vanity of his fame as champion for the public good, blinding Brutus to the evil nature of the conspiracy.</p></section><section class=note id=divinecomedy ng-show=\"vm.isVisible(\'divinecomedy\')\"><h3><i>The Divine Comedy</i></h3><p><i><a href=http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.html>The Divine Comedy</a></i>, Dante Alighieri\'s classic allegorical story, in which Dante himself becomes a pilgrim traveling through the three kingdoms of the afterlife: hell (<i>The Inferno)</i>, purgatory (<i>Purgatorio</i>), and heaven (<i>Paradiso</i>).

It is a story full of hollow men- men empty of faith, personality, moral strength, and even humanity. In it the character Marlow tells of his own journey into the heart of Africa, a dark world populated by morally empty men living only for ivory and the money and power that it brings. Deep in the interior, he meets Kurtz, the most depraved man of them all, yet one who, on his deathbed, seems to realize the true horror of what he and humanity as he knows it is and does.</p></section><section class=note id=1925 ng-show=\"vm.isVisible(\'1925\')\"><h3>1925</h3><p>Eliot wrote this poem during a period of absence from the bank, having just suffered a nervous breakdown.

It is also a common building material for effigies used in harvest or fertility rituals celebrating the symbolic death of a vegetation god as necessary for the rebirth and growth of the land. One of these, observed by both <a href=Quotes.htm#FrazerArgei>Sir James Frazer</a> and <a href=Quotes.htm#FowlerArgei>W. Warde Fowler</a> is the Roman ritual of the Argei. This imagery suggests that a sacrifice of the \'hollow men\' can redeem mankind and that after their destruction we can again flourish.</p><p>Eliot examined a similar myth, that of the Fisher King, extensively in <i><a href=http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html>The Waste Land</a></i>. The Fisher King myth has many variations, but generally includes an ailing king whose kingdom is sterile- nothing will grow, and the people suffer. The king and the land can only be cured by a pure quest for some sort of knowledge (sometimes in the form of an object, sometimes in a question that must be asked). It is also frequently associated with the Arthurian quest for the Holy Grail and the knight Perceval. Ususally, with the success of the quest, the king and the land are healed. Sometimes the king must die and be succeeded before the land can again bloom. The theme of a king or god needing to die, at least symbolically, for the land to become fertile (for spring to come) also occurs in the Summerian myth of Inanna and Demuzi, the rituals surrounding the Egyptian god Osris, and the Greek myth of Persephone and Demeter.</p></section><section class=note id=six ng-show=\"vm.isVisible(\'six\')\"><p>l. 6: Whispers act as an instrument of fate throughout <i><a ng-click=\"vm.showNote(\'heartofdarkness\')\">HoD</a></i>. Marlow recounts how the wilderness \"had whispered to [Kurtz] things about himself which he did not know ... and the whisper proved irresistibly fascinating. It echoed loudly within him because he was hollow at the core\".<sup><font size=-2><a href=Footnotes.htm#notesfour>4</a></font></sup> And while Marlow attempts and fails to summon up the courage to tell Kurtz\'s Intended the truth about Kurtz\'s last words, those words are whispered in his mind, signifying his own hollowness and cowardice. Besides symbolizing fate, whispers can also signify conspiracy, a theme present throughout this poem and seemingly inherent in the hollow men.</p></section><section class=note id=eleventwelve ng-show=\"vm.isVisible(\'eleventwelve\')\"><p>ll. 11-12: This refers to a condition of unfulfillment as seen in the spiritual state of the shades in <i><a ng-click=\"vm.showNote(\'divinecomedy\')\">Inferno iii</a></i>. These shades never made a choice regarding their spiritual state during life (neither following nor rebelling against God) instead living solely for themselves. Neither heaven nor hell will let them past its gates. A similar condition exists, in <i>HoD</i>, among the men of the Eldorado Exploring Expedition: they lacked the moral strength and courage to back up their greed. A third explanation of the lines is Marlow\'s own experience with and resistance of death. Here we see that the same description that applies to the hollow men can also be applied to what is experienced by those who attempt to struggle against that empty way of life and death.</p></section><section class=note id=thirteenfifteen ng-show=\"vm.isVisible(\'thirteenfifteen\')\"><p>ll. 13-15: Those who have crossed to death\'s other kingdom are those who have left behind a state of spiritual nothingness (or, alternatively, hell or purgatory) and entered into knowledge and recognition of that state ( or heaven). They are the ones who are capable of looking directly at life and the universe and seeing the inner truth. Kurtz, though probably not heaven bound, had the same moment of realization just before his death, as seen in his stare and his final utterance, \"The horror! The horror!\" The idea of crossing refers to a transition from one state to the other, such as when Dante the Pilgrim had to cross to rivers to be freed from sin and shame before his eyes could stand to look upon his beloved Beatrice in heaven. This is a plea from the hollow men to those who have escaped their fate. Like the numerous souls who beg Dante to keep their memory alive, they are asking for those lucky souls to remember the fate of those less fortunate, and to also remember that they were not seeking to do wrong, but simply lacked what the lucky ones have, morals and values.</p></section><section class=note id=fifteen ng-show=\"vm.isVisible(\'fifteen\')\"><p>l. 15: The song sung by children begging for pennies on <a href=\"http://web.idirect.com/~redsonja/guy/\">Guy Fawkes Day</a> begins \"Please to remember / The fifth of November / Gunpowder, treason, and plot.\"</p></section><section class=note id=nineteen ng-show=\"vm.isVisible(\'nineteen\')\"><p>l. 19: Beatrice tells Dante how she came to him first in dreams to lead him back to the part of virtue.

He acts like a disobedient child unable to meet a stern parent\'s gaze until he is purified by the waters of the River Lethe. Marlow encounters the force of eyes and glances throughout his adventures, ranging from the invisible eyes of the forest, to Kurtz\'s dying gaze, to the \"guileless, profound, confident, and trustful\" gaze of Kurtz\'s intended.<sup><font size=-2><a href=Footnotes.htm#notesfive>5</a></font></sup> The hollow men should be shamed by the eyes of the virtuous, but at the same time those eyes contain within them a chance for redemption. This is an opportunity Dante the pilgrim accepted and Marlow refused.</p></section><section class=note id=twentytwentytwo ng-show=\"vm.isVisible(\'twentytwentytwo\')\"><p>ll. 20-22: In heaven, Dante no longer feels shamed by Beatrice\'s gaze, but instead, marvels in her beauty, which continues to grow as they advance to the uppermost strata of heaven. Once the invitation for redemption is accepted and virtue is restored, the formerly hollow man has no reason to feel shame when looking into the eyes of the virtuous. \"Death\'s dream kingdom\" is heaven; in order to have reached that paradise, even if by means of a guide, the soul must already have been purified.

Weston looks at the staves of Morris Dancers, clowns in a costume of animal skins or a cap of skin. She sees them as a surviving remnant of earlier vegetation ceremonies.

At this point, he has completed the unpleasant stages of his journey, which is really an attempt to save his own soul, so that after his own death he will be able to join her in heaven. Marlow also faces the crux of his journey when he faces Kurtz\'s fianc&eacute;, but he chooses a darker path. He follows through on his word to Kurtz by giving her his letters, but he can not bring himself to tell the truth about his last words. In his submission to the heart of darkness he faces a moral twilight in which he chooses the shadow, literally, as the sun sets.
