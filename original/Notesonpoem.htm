<a NAME="Title" TARGET="notes"></a>

<p>Title: Eliot claimed to have made up the title, "The Hollow Men" from
    combining "The Hollow Land", the title of a romance by William Morris with
    Kipling's title, "The Broken Men".&nbsp; Many scholars believe this to
    be one of Ol' Possum's many false trails, instead believing it comes from
    a mention of '<a href="Quotes.htm#JCIVii">hollow
        men</a>' in <i>Julius Caesar </i>or any of several references to Joseph
    Conrad's Kurtz as hollow in some way (a 'hollow sham', 'hollow at the core').&nbsp;
    The title immediately presents us with the first of many allusions, directly
    referencing two of the four main sources for this poem, Shakespeare's <i><a href="#juliuscaesar">Julius
        Caesar</a>,</i> and Conrad's <i><a href="#heartofdarkness">Heart of Darkness</a></i>
    (which I will often abbreviate <i>HoD</i>).&nbsp; The other sources are
    the <a href="#gunpowderplot">Gunpowder Plot</a> and <i><a href="#divinecomedy">The
        Divine Comedy</a></i>, both of which also deal with men or shadows of men
    who may be described as hollow at the core.

<a NAME="gunpowderplot"></a>

<p><a href="http://www.gunpowder-plot.org">The Gunpowder Plot</a>: This
    conspiracy arose from the English Catholics' resentment of King James I
    and his reign's treatment of their religion.&nbsp; A group of extremists
    led by Rober Catesby planed to seize power by killing King James I and
    his ministers at the State Opening of Parliament (November 5, 1605), leaving
    England without a government. Francis Tresham, one of the conspirators,
    gave the plan away when he wrote to his brother-in-law, Lord Monteagle,
    telling him to stay away from the Houses of Parliament during the Opening.&nbsp;
    Monteagle informed the Lord Chancellor of the warning, who in turn told
    the king.&nbsp; On November 4, 1605, Guy Fawkes was arrested in the cellars
    of the House of Lords, standing guard over two tons of gunpowder.&nbsp;
    He was tortured until he revealed the names of his co-conspirators, who,
    if they hadn't yet fled the country, were soon executed. Now the British
    celebrate November 5 with bonfires, fireworks, and by burning effigies
    of Guy.&nbsp; Theoretically, they are celebrating the execution of a traitor,
    though some have been been known to see it as a celebration of the near
    death of the monarchy.

<p><i><a href="http://tech-two.mit.edu/Shakespeare/julius_caesar/index.html">Julius
    Caesar</a></i>: Shakespeare's version of the <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/caesar.html">story
    of Julius Caesar</a> also centers around a violent conspiracy of men who
    are blinded by their cause. In it, Brutus, a leading Roman citizen, is
    approached by Cassius, who is recruiting people to conspire to assassinate
    Caesar.&nbsp; Cassius is motivated by ambition, envy, and malice, and he
    persuades Brutus that Caesar is a tyrant who will destroy the Roman Republic.&nbsp;
    Cassius plays on Brutus's vanity of his fame as champion for the public
    good, blinding Brutus to the evil nature of the conspiracy.

<p><i><a href="http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.html">The Divine
    Comedy</a></i>: Dante Alighieri's classic allegorical story in which, Dante
    himself becomes a pilgrim traveling through the three kingdoms of the afterlife:
    hell (<i>The Inferno)</i>, purgatory (<i>Purgatorio</i>), and heaven (<i>Paradiso</i>).&nbsp;
    He is lead through the first two by the poet Virgil in a pilgrimage orchestrated
    by his late love Beatrice in an attempt to redeem his soul and convince
    him to change his life so that after seeing Beatrice in heaven he will
    desire to join her there again after his own death.

<p><i><a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/irvinemj/english016/conrad/heart.of.darkness.txt">Heart
    of Darkness</a></i>: Next to Dante's writing, this story by Joseph Conrad
    is commonly held to be most important and influential literary experience
    in Eliot's poetry.&nbsp; It is a story full of hollow men- men empty of
    faith, personality, moral strength, and even humanity.&nbsp; In it the
    character Marlow tells of his own journey into the heart of Africa, a dark
    world populated by morally empty men living only for ivory and the money
    and power that it brings.&nbsp; Deep in the interior, he meets Kurtz, the
    most depraved man of them all, yet one who, on his deathbed, seems to realize
    the true horror of what he and humanity as he knows it is and does.

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="composition"></a>

<p>1925: Eliot wrote this poem during a period of absence from the bank,
    having just suffered a nervous breakdown.&nbsp; The theme of 'hollowness'
    presented in the poem directly relates to his own psychological condition
    at the time, a condition known at the time as 'aboulie'.<sup><font size=-2><a
            href="Footnotes.htm#Notesone">1</a></font></sup>

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="epigraphtosection"></a>

<p>epigraph to section: The words spoken by a servant to announce Kurtz's
    death.&nbsp; They signal the end of an evil presence, but also the end
    of one who was formerly a great man.&nbsp; With his death the values he
    held during life also die, leaving the survivors without anything to guide
    them.

<a NAME="onefour"></a>

<p>ll.1-4: The 'hollow men' and 'stuffed men', 'filled with straw' are
    a combination of the effigies burned on Guy Fawkes Day, the conspirators
    in <i>Julius Caesar</i>, and Kurtz.&nbsp; More profoundly, they are Eliot's
    modern man, an empty, corrupt breed.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="two"></a>

<p>l. 2: According to Valerie Eliot, the marionette in Stravinsky's <a
        href="http://balletdance.about.com/arts/balletdance/library/weekly/aa112398.htm"><i>Petrouchka</i>.</a><sup><font
        size=-2><a href="Footnotes.htm#notestwo">2</a></font></sup>

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="four"></a>

<p>l. 4: Straw is the usual filling for the effigies burned on <a href="http://web.idirect.com/~redsonja/guy/">Guy
    Fawkes Day</a>.&nbsp; It is also a common building material for effigies
    used in harvest or fertility rituals celebrating the symbolic death of
    a vegetation god as necessary for the rebirth and growth of the land.&nbsp;
    One of these, observed by both <a href="Quotes.htm#FrazerArgei">Sir
        James Frazer</a> and <a href="Quotes.htm#FowlerArgei">W.
        Warde Fowler</a> is the Roman ritual of the Argei.&nbsp; This imagery suggests
    that a sacrifice of the 'hollow men' can redeem mankind and that after
    their destruction we can again flourish.

<p>Eliot examined a similar myth, that of the Fisher King, extensively
    in <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html">The Waste Land</a></i>.&nbsp;
    The Fisher King myth has many variations, but generally includes an ailing
    king whose kingdom is sterile- nothing will grow, and the people suffer.&nbsp;
    The king and the land can only be cured by a pure quest for some sort of
    knowledge (sometimes in the form of an object, sometimes in a question
    that must be asked).&nbsp; It is also frequently associated with the Arthurian
    quest for the Holy Grail and the knight Perceval.&nbsp; Ususally, with
    the success of the quest, the king and the land are healed.&nbsp; Sometimes
    the king must die and be succeeded before the land can again bloom.&nbsp;
    The theme of a king or god needing to die, at least symbolically, for the
    land to become fertile (for spring to come) also occurs in the Summerian
    myth of Inanna and Demuzi, the rituals surrounding the Egyptian god Osris,
    and the Greek myth of Persephone and Demeter.

<a NAME="six"></a>

<p>l. 6: Whispers act as an instrument of fate throughout
    <i><a href="#heartofdarkness">HoD</a></i>.&nbsp;
    Marlow recounts how the wilderness "had whispered to [Kurtz] things about
    himself which he did not know ... and the whisper proved irresistibly fascinating.
    It echoed loudly within him because he was hollow at the core".<sup><font size=-2><a href="Footnotes.htm#notesfour">4</a></font></sup>&nbsp;
    And while Marlow attempts and fails to summon up the courage to tell Kurtz's
    Intended the truth about Kurtz's last words, those words are whispered
    in his mind, signifying his own hollowness and cowardice.&nbsp; Besides
    symbolizing fate, whispers can also signify conspiracy, a theme present
    throughout this poem and seemingly inherent in the hollow men.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="eleventwelve"></a>

<p>ll. 11-12: This refers to a condition of unfulfillment as seen in the
    spiritual state of the shades in <i><a href="#divinecomedy">Inferno iii</a></i>.&nbsp;
    These shades never made a choice regarding their spiritual state during
    life (neither following nor rebelling against God) instead living solely
    for themselves.&nbsp; Neither heaven nor hell will let them past its gates.&nbsp;
    A similar condition exists, in <i>HoD</i>, among the men of the Eldorado
    Exploring Expedition: they lacked the moral strength and courage to back
    up their greed.&nbsp; A third explanation of the lines is Marlow's own
    experience with and resistance of death.&nbsp; Here we see that the same
    description that applies to the hollow men can also be applied to what
    is experienced by those who attempt to struggle against that empty way
    of life and death.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="thirteenfifteen"></a>

<p>ll. 13-15: Those who have crossed to death's other kingdom are those
    who have left behind a state of spiritual nothingness (or, alternatively,
    hell or purgatory) and entered into knowledge and recognition of that state
    ( or heaven).&nbsp; They are the ones who are capable of looking directly
    at life and the universe and seeing the inner truth. Kurtz, though probably
    not heaven bound, had the same moment of realization just before his death,
    as seen in his stare and his final utterance, "The horror! The horror!"&nbsp;
    The idea of crossing refers to a transition from one state to the other,
    such as when Dante the Pilgrim had to cross to rivers to be freed from
    sin and shame before his eyes could stand to look upon his beloved Beatrice
    in heaven.&nbsp; This is a plea from the hollow men to those who have escaped
    their fate.&nbsp; Like the numerous souls who beg Dante to keep their memory
    alive, they are asking for those lucky souls to remember the fate of those
    less fortunate, and to also remember that they were not seeking to do wrong,
    but simply lacked what the lucky ones have, morals and values.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="fifteen"></a>

<p>l. 15: The song sung by children begging for pennies on <a href="http://web.idirect.com/~redsonja/guy/">Guy
    Fawkes Day</a> begins "Please to remember / The fifth of November / Gunpowder,
    treason, and plot."

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="nineteen"></a>

<p>l. 19: Beatrice tells Dante how she came to him first in dreams to lead
    him back to the part of virtue.&nbsp; Just as Beatrice give Dante a chance
    for redemption by orchestrating his&nbsp; journey, all men also have the
    chance for redemption.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="nineteentwentytwo"></a>

<p>ll. 19-22: Dante cannot meet Beatrice's eyes when he first sees her
    because he still feels shame and suffers their reprove.&nbsp; He acts like
    a disobedient child unable to meet a stern parent's gaze until he is purified
    by the waters of the River Lethe.&nbsp; Marlow encounters the force of
    eyes and glances throughout his adventures, ranging from the invisible
    eyes of the forest, to Kurtz's dying gaze, to the "guileless, profound,
    confident, and trustful" gaze of Kurtz's intended.<sup><font size=-2><a href="Footnotes.htm#notesfive">5</a></font></sup>&nbsp;
    The hollow men should be shamed by the eyes of the virtuous, but at the
    same time those eyes contain within them a chance for redemption.&nbsp;
    This is an opportunity Dante the pilgrim accepted and Marlow refused.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="twentytwentytwo"></a>

<p>ll. 20-22: In heaven, Dante no longer feels shamed by Beatrice's gaze,
    but instead, marvels in her beauty, which continues to grow as they advance
    to the uppermost strata of heaven.&nbsp; Once the invitation for redemption
    is accepted and virtue is restored, the formerly hollow man has no reason
    to feel shame when looking into the eyes of the virtuous.&nbsp; "Death's
    dream kingdom" is heaven; in order to have reached that paradise, even
    if by means of a guide, the soul must already have been purified.&nbsp;
    He does not see the same shame causing eyes he saw originally, instead
    he sees a gaze that he can meet.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="twentythreetwentyeight"></a>

<p>ll. 23-28: These lines resemble the Dante's description of the Earthly
    Paradise, when still seen from afar in Cantos <i>xxvii-xxix</i>.&nbsp;
    Dante used the star as a symbol representing God or Mary.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p>l. 23: A broken column is a traditional graveyard memorial for a premature
    death.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="twentyfour"></a>

<p>l. 24: A book Eliot reviewed in 1923, <i>The Sacred Dance</i> by W.O.E.
    Oesterley contains the image of a 'savage' who is awestruck by 'a tree,
    swayed by wind, moved'.<sup><font size=-2><a href="Footnotes.htm#notessix">6</a></font></sup>

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="thirtytwo"></a>

<p>l. 32: In the section "The Propitiation of Vermin by Farmers" in <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/196/">The
    Golden Bough</a></i> Frazer discusses both the dressing in animal skins
    for ritualistic purposes, as well as the custom of hanging up the corpse
    of a member of a crop damaging species as a possible origin of the scarecrow.
    Weston looks at the staves of Morris Dancers, clowns in a costume of animal
    skins or a cap of skin.&nbsp; She sees them as a surviving remnant of earlier
    vegetation ceremonies.&nbsp; Where the previous stanza showed the beauty
    present in paradise and the hope a tormented soul has of reaching that
    place, this one and the next show that souls fear in the obstacles that
    will have to overcome before that can happen.

Fisher King
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="thirtyfive"></a>

<p>l. 35: In the <i><a href="#divinecomedy">Inferno</a></i> spirits are
    blown about by the wind and in <i><a href="#heartofdarkness">HoD</a></i>
    the native dies just because he left the shutter open, "He had no restraint-
    just like Kurtz- a tree swayed in the wind."<sup><font size=-2><a href="Footnotes.htm#notesseven">7</a></font></sup>

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="thirtyseventhirtyeight"></a>

<p>ll. 37-38: Both Dante the Pilgrim and Marlow must face a meeting they
    greatly fear.&nbsp; Dante must meet Beatrice and face her divine beauty.&nbsp;
    In doing so he can't help but be reminded of all of his own sins and failings,
    but by crossing the River Lethe, which flows in shadow, he can be purified
    and look upon her.&nbsp; At this point, he has completed the unpleasant
    stages of his journey, which is really an attempt to save his own soul,
    so that after his own death he will be able to join her in heaven.&nbsp;
    Marlow also faces the crux of his journey when he faces Kurtz's fianc&eacute;,
    but he chooses a darker path.&nbsp; He follows through on his word to Kurtz
    by giving her his letters, but he can not bring himself to tell the truth
    about his last words.&nbsp; In his submission to the heart of darkness
    he faces a moral twilight in which he chooses the shadow, literally, as
    the sun sets.&nbsp; The twilight that sets in is the choice the soul must
    face between light and darkness.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="thirtyninefortyfour"></a>

<p>ll. 39-44: These lines are thought to be material originally discarded
    from <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html">The Waste Land</a></i>
    as they closely resemble lines from sections I and V both in language and
    imagery.&nbsp; The stone images (and 'broken stone' in l. 51) suggests
    idolatrous worship.&nbsp; "The worship of stones is a degradation of a
    higher form of worship," F.B. Jevens's <i>An Introduction to the History
        of Religions</i>, a 1896 text Eliot is known to have studied at Harvard.<sup><font size=-2><a
            href="Footnotes.htm#noteseight">8</a></font></sup>
    The desert imagery suggests sterility, probably the sterility of the modern
    world.

<a NAME="fortyninefiftyone"></a>

<p>ll. 49-51: To the end, Kurtz's Intended is confident in his faithfulness,
    goodness, and unending love for her, while in reality he has turned to
    the worship of pagan forces (stone is symbolic of idolatrous and thus,
    non-Christian worship).

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="fiftyfiftyone"></a>

<p>ll. 50-51: A perversion of Juliet's line about "lips that they must
    use in prayer" instead of for kissing.&nbsp; Kurtz's lips are being used
    in pagan worship instead of to express love for his Intended.&nbsp; Also,
    from Psalm 57, as used in <i><a href="#divinecomedy">Purgatorio xxii, xxxiii</a>,</i>
    "Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall show forth thy praise!"

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="fiftytwofiftysix"></a>

<p>ll. 52-56: The valley Marlow walks through upon his arrival to the Congo,
    half excavated, littered with abandoned objects, and hopeless native laborers,
    "it seemed to me I had stepped into the gloomy circle of some Inferno ...
    Black shapes crouched, lay sat between the trees, leaning against the trunks,
    clinging to the earth, half coming out, half effaced with in the dim light,
    in all the attitudes of pain, abandonment, and despair."<sup><font size=-2><a
            href="Footnotes.htm#notesten">10</a></font></sup>&nbsp;
    Like <a href="#thirtyninefortyfour">ll. 39-44</a>, a representation of

<a NAME="fiftysix"></a>

<p>l. 56: Possibly the "new jaw bone of an ass" (Judges xv, 15-19) with
    which Samson slew a thousand Philistines.&nbsp; This would seem to signify
    that the civilizing factor has broken, contributing to, or allowing, modern
    man's decline.&nbsp; <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/196/">The Golden
        Bough</a></i> offers an anthropological explanation; the Baganda (and African
    tribe) believe that the spirit of the dead clings to the jawbone.&nbsp;
    The jaw bone of their deceased king is made into an effigy and put in a
    temple.&nbsp; Again, since the bone is broken, any leadership that could
    have taken from the talisman is no longer available.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="fiftysevensixty"></a>

<p>ll. 57-60: These lines allude to all four major sources: the last meeting
    places and tumid rivers encountered by the Pilgrim on his journey, the
    element of conspiracy (last meetings before the treasonous act) in <i><a href="#juliuscaesar">Julius
        Caesar</a></i> and of the <a href="#gunpowderplot">Gunpowder Plot</a>,
    and Marlow's experiences with the secretive trading company, "It was just
    as though I had been let into some conspiracy."<sup><font size=-2><a href="Footnotes.htm#noteseleven">11</a></font></sup>&nbsp;
    At the trading station he finds that most of the white employees occupy
    themselves "by backbiting and intriguing against each other in a foolish
    kind of way.&nbsp; There was an air of plotting about the station, but
    nothing came of it, of course it was as unreal as everything else."<sup><font size=-2><a
            href="Footnotes.htm#notestwelve">12</a></font></sup>&nbsp;
    This is the final meeting of a doomed conspiracy, the meeting of the lost,
    hollow souls before they sentenced to the inferno.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="sixty"></a>

<p>l. 60: Dante's River Acheron flowing around hell or the river Marlow
    follows into the African 'heart of darkness'.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="sixtyonesixtytwo"></a>

<p>ll. 61-62:<b> </b>If the eyes reappear, so does hope and the possibility
    for salvation.&nbsp; At Dante the Pilgrim's first meeting with Beatrice,
    her eyes were shameful for him to look upon, yet they also signaled the
    possibility of his redemption.&nbsp; When he is able to look upon her again
    it signifies a change in the state of his soul, it has been purified.&nbsp;
    When Marlow meets Kurtz's Intended, he is looked upon by the eyes of a
    pure spirit, "The room seemed to have drown darker, as if all the sad light
    of the cloudy evening had taken refuge on her forehead. This fair hair,
    this pale visage, this pure brow, seemed surrounded by an ashy halo from
    which dark eyes looked out at me.&nbsp; Their glance was guileless, profound,
    and trustful."<sup><font size=-2><a href="Footnotes.htm#notesthirteen">13</a></font></sup>&nbsp;
    That moment Marlow's chance to resist the darkness which has penetrated
    modern life.

<p>ll. 63-64: In <i><a href="#divinecomedy">Paradiso xxx</a></i> the Pilgrim's
    vision of the highest level of heaven is of a rose whose petals are formed
    by Mary and the saints. In <i><a href="#divinecomedy">Paradiso xxxi</a></i>
    he refers to God as the 'single star', and in <i><a href="#divinecomedy">Paradiso
        xxxii</a></i> and elsewhere he refers to Mary as a rose.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="sixtyfive"></a>

<p>l. 65: The twilight refers to Marlow's meeting with Kurtz's Intended,
    to the twilight that is physically gathering, and to the hopelessness in
    Marlow's own soul.&nbsp; Twilight represents a choice, but it can also
    be the mere memory of that choice.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="sixtyeightseventy"></a>

<p>ll. 68-71: These lines parody a children's song that is derived from
    a fertility dance&nbsp; done around a mulberry bush 'on a cold and frosty
    morning'. A prickly pear is a desert cactus, continuing the desert imagery
    that is particularly prevalent at the beginning of the third section of
    the poem. 5:00am is the traditional time of Christ's resurrection.&nbsp;
    In a 1923 review Eliot quoted Frazer on "how often with the decay of old
    faiths the serious rites and pageants .. [primitive, religious dances]
    have degenerated into the sports of children."<sup><font size=-2><a href="Footnotes.htm#notesfourteen">14</a></font></sup>
    Here he has further perverted the children's song by turning it into a
    modern infertility dance.&nbsp; By performing an infertility dance at the
    moment of resurrection, we are in effect blocking and rejecting the salvation
    it can bring.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<a NAME="seventytwoninety"></a>

<p>ll. 72-90: Taken almost directly from <a
        href="http://tech-two.mit.edu/Shakespeare/julius_caesar/julius_caesar.2.1.html"><i>Julius
    Caesar</i> II.i</a>:

<p>BRUTUS
<blockquote>Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    <br>And the first motion, all the interm is
    <br>Like a phantasma, or hideous dream:

    <br>Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    <br>The nature of an insurrection.
</blockquote>
Another possible source is the line "Between the void and its pure issue"
from Val&eacute;ry's <i>The Cemetery by the Sea</i>.&nbsp; In 1924, Eliot
wrote an introduction to Val&eacute;ry's<i> Le Serpent</i> in which he
compared that line to Brutus's lines.&nbsp; He viewed <i>The Cemetery by
    the Sea</i> as an expression of Valery's melancholy skepticism attributed
to "the agony of creation ... the mind constantly mocks and dissuades,
and urges the creative activity in vain." The three central stanzas of
this section closely resemble Valery's in their phrasal structure and emphatic
rhythm and also in their thematic contrast between 'idea' and 'reality'.<sup><font size=-2><a

<p>This section of the poem deals with the true cause of hollowness- failing
    to make that choice that was once offered, failing to take action, giving
    in and living only as a shadow.&nbsp; The shadow has had a chance to recognize
    the difference between salvation and damnation and has either rejected
    that chance or failed to choose between the two.

<p>l. 76: In 1935 Eliot accepted a suggestion that he had taken the 'Shadow'
    from "Non sum qualis eram" (I am not now as once I was) Ernest Dowson's
    most famous poem.&nbsp; It contains the phrases "Then fell thy shadow"
    and "Then falls the shadow." He is quoted as responding, "This derivation
    had not occurred in my mind, but I believe it to be correct, because the
    lines... have always run in my head."<sup><font size=-2><a href="Footnotes.htm#notessixteen">16</a></font></sup>

    <i><a href="#heartofdarkness">HoD</a></i> also features shadows throughout:
    the boat moves in shadow, men die with shadows across their faces, pain
    is experienced in shadow, Kurtz's secrets are metaphorical shadows, Kurtz
    himself is a "Shadow - that wandering and tormented thing,"<sup><font size=-2><a
            href="Footnotes.htm#notesseventeen">17</a></font></sup>
    and at the end of the story a shadow stretches across the sky, a shadow
    over all of mankind.

<p>l. 83: Like <a href="#seventyseven">l. 77 and l. 91</a>, this line is
    italicized, suggesting a quotation. In this case it is from Conrad's <i>An
        Outcast of the Islands</i>, in which a broken man is punished by being
    kept alive rather than by being killed.

    form gives it existence".

<p>ll. 88-89: From Platonic philosophy, "the essence is the inapprehensible
    ideal, which finds material expression in its descent to the lower, material
    plane of reality."

<p>ll. 95-98: Here, Eliot is again parodying the children's song 'Here
    we go round the mulberry bush,' specifically the line "this is the way
    we clap our hands".&nbsp; He's also referring to the biblical idea of a
    world without end from, "Glory be to the Father, to the Son, and to the
    Holy Ghost, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world
    without end.&nbsp; Amen"

<p>l. 98: George Santayana lectured at Harvard while Eliot was a student
    there.&nbsp; His account of the Divine Comedy included: "it all ends, not
    with a bang, not with some casual incident, but in sustained reflection."<sup><font size=-2><a
            href="Footnotes.htm#noteseightteen">18</a></font></sup>&nbsp;
    The whimper could be in reference to two things: the Kipling poem, <a href="Quotes.htm#kipling">"Danny
        Deever"</a>, with which Eliot is known to have been familier and Dante's
    description of a newborn baby's cry upon leaving one world to enter another.&nbsp;
    That in turns suggests the image of a repentant Dante standing before Beatrice
    as a child before as stern parent.

<p>The whimper is that Guy Fawkes exhaled when he gave up his co-conspirators,
    it is what Brutus and Cassius spoke when their plans to rule crumbled,
    it is Kurtz's last utterance when he finally realizes the truth of the
    world he lives in, and it is the end for all hollow men.
