<a NAME="JCIVii"></a>Spoken by Brutus when he learns that Cassius
is not being so friendly towards him.
<blockquote>But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
<br>Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
<br>But when they should endure the bloody spur,
<br>They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
<br>Sink in trial.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...it is possible that the puppets made of rushes, which in
the month of May the pontiffs and Vestal Virgins annually threw into the
Tiber from the old Sublician bridge at Rome had originally the same significance
[as the Roman festival Compitalia]; that is, they may have been designed
to purge the city from demoniac influence by diverting the attention of
the demons from human beings to the puppets and then toppling the whole
uncanny crew, neck and crop, into the river, which would soon sweep them
far out to sea... This interpretation of Roman custom is supported to some
extent by the evidence of Plutarch, who speaks of the ceremony as "the
greatest of purifications".</blockquote>

<blockquote>...each year on the ides of March, which is in my view rather
magical than religious, though the ancients themselves looked upon it as
a kind of purification, [namely] the casting into the Tiber from the Pons
Sublicius of twenty-four or twenty-seven straw puppets by the Vestal Virgins
in the presence of the magistrates and pontifices. Recently an attempt
has been made by Wissowa to prove that this strange ceremony was not primitive,
but simply a case of substitution of puppets for real human victims as
late as the age of the Punic wars. These puppets were called Argei, which
naturally suggests Greeks; and Wissowa has contrived to persuade himself
not only that a number of Greeks were actually put to death by drowning
in an age when everything Greek was beginning to be reverenced at Rome,
but (still more extraordinary to an anthropologist) that primitive device
of substitution was had in requisition at that late date in order to carry
on the memory of that ghastly deed. And the world of German learning has
silently followed their leader, without taking the trouble to test his
conclusions... whatever be the history of the accessories of the rite -
and they are various and puzzling, -- that the actual immersion of the
puppets is the survival of a primitive piece of sympathetic magic, the
object being possibly to procure rain.</blockquote>

place in an impalpable greyness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around,

of the tepid skepticism, with out much belief in your own fight, and still
less in that of your adversary ... a

<p>George P. Landow <i>Hypertext 2.0</i>
<blockquote>Hypertext, which is a fundamentally intertextual system, has
the capacity to emphasize intertextuality in a way that page-bound text
in books cannot. As we have already observed, scholarly articles and books
offer an obvious example of explicit hypertextuality in nonelectronic form.
Conversely, any work of literature -- which for the sake of argument and
economy I shall here confine in a most arbitrary way to mean "high" literature
of the sort we read and teach in universities -- offers an instance of
implicit hypertext in nonelectronic form. Again, take Joyce's Ulysses for
an example. If one looks, say, at the Nausicaa section, in which Bloom
watches Gerty McDowell on the beach, one notes that Joyce's text here "alludes"
or "refers" (the terms we usually employ) to many other texts or phenomena
that one can treat as texts, including the Nausicaa section of the Odyssey,
the advertisements and articles in the women's magazines that suffuse and
inform Gerty's thoughts, facts about contemporary Dublin and the Catholic
Church, and material that relates to other passages within the novel. Again,
a hypertext presentation of the novel links this section not only to the
kinds of materials mentioned but also to other works in Joyce's career,
critical commentary, and textual variants. Hypertext here permits one to
make explicit, though not necessarily intrusive, the linked materials that
an educated reader perceives surrounding it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thaiums Morgan suggests that intertextuality, "as a structural
analysis of texts in relation to the larger system of signifying practices
or uses of signs in culture," shifts attention from the triad constituted
by author/work/tradition to another constituted by text/discourse/culture.
In so doing, "intertextuality replaces the evolutionary model of literary
history with a structural or synchronic model of literature as a sign system.
The most salient effect of this strategic change is to free the literary
text from psychological, sociological, and historical determinisms, opening
it up to an apparently infinite play of relationships" (1-2). Morgan well
describes a major implication of hypertext (and hypermedia) intertextuality:
such opening up, such freeing one to create and perceive interconnections,
obviously occurs. Nonetheless, although hypertext intertextuality would
seem to devalue any historic or other reductionism, it in no way prevents
those interested in reading in terms of author and tradition from doing
so. Experiments thus far with Intermedia, HyperCard, and other hypertext
systems suggest that hypertext does not necessarily turn one's attention
away from such approaches. What is perhaps most interesting about hypertext,
though, is not that it may fulfill certain claims of structuralist and
poststructuralist criticism but that it provides a rich means of testing
them.</blockquote>

what his poems 'mean' than anyone else; he may know the history of their
composition, the material which has gone in and come out in an unrecognizable
form, and he knows what he was trying to do and what he was meaning to
mean. But what a poem means is as much what it means to others as what
it means to the author; and indeed, in the course of time a poet may become
merely a reader in respect to his own works, forgetting his original meaning,

<p>On the advantages of tracing annotations in a hypertext document:
<blockquote>This kind of reading constitutes the basic experience and starting
point of hypertext. Suppose now that one could simply touch the page where
the symbol of a note, reference, or annotation appeared, and thus instantly
bring into view the material contained in a note or even in the entire
other text - here all of <i>Ulysses</i> - to which that note refers. Scholarly
articles situate themselves within a field of relations, most of which
the print medium keeps out of sight and relatively difficult to follow,
because in print technology the referenced (or linked) materials lie spatially
distant from the references to them. Electronic hypertext, in contrast,
makes individual references easy to follow and the entire field of interconnections
obvious and easy to navigate. Changing the ease with which one can orient
oneself and pursue individual references within such a context radically
changes bot the experience of reading and ultimately the nature of what
is read. For example, if one possessed a hypertext system in which our
putative Joyce article was linked to all of the other materials it cited,
the article would exist as part of a much larger totality, which might
count more than the individual document; the article would now be woven
more tightly into its context than would a printed counterpart.</blockquote>
