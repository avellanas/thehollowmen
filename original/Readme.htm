This paper's a little different from the standard English paper.
It is written as a hypertext document. Instead of being one long paper
it is a collection of shorter essays joined by links from the main page,
and also by internal links. There are also purely internal links that may
go to an example, explanation, definition, or related discussion elsewhere
in the project. Additionally, there are links to external web sites that
contain related documents or information. Basically, the links follow a
format similar to that found on most web pages. The internal links are
<u><font color="#0000FF">blue
and underlined</font></u>. After they have been followed both kinds of
links will be <u><font color="#800080">purple</font></u>. The external
links will only work when the computer you are reading this document on
is connected to the internet through the campus network or some other internet
service provider.
<p>This document is meant to be viewed on the web by any web browser, but
can also be viewed as stand alone files, again by any browser running on
any operating system (however, it has only been tested with fairly recent
versions of each and may not work quite right on older machines or machines
with older browsers).
<p>Clicking on a link will open the link (web page or different part of
this document) in the same window. Click the back arrow in the web toolbar
to return to the previous part of the document. If you wish to open the
link in a new window: on a PC: right click over the link, highlight hypertext,
and then select 'open in new window', on a Macintosh: click and hold over
the link, highlight 'New window for this link' and release the mouse.
<p>The hypertext version of <a href="Poem.htm">"The
Hollow Men"</a> is slightly different in that it allows the reader to view
the poem on one side of the screen and the annotations and analysis on
the other.&nbsp; Both sides can be scrolled independently, or clicking
a link on the poem will scroll the notes automatically so that the appropriate
note is at the top of the screen.
<p>Once you follow a link, whether to another portion of this project or
to an external source, clicking your browser's back button will take you
back to what you were originally looking at.
<p>If the text is too small to read easily, (in Netscape) you can change
the font size by going to the edit menu, selecting preferences, selecting
fonts from the left hand side of the screen and selecting a larger font
on the right hand side.
