   <title>Hamlet Example</title>

<a NAME="Example"></a>A specific example of this appears
in the last line of the second section of <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html">The
Waste Land</a></i>, "A Game of Chess", "Good night, ladies, good night,
sweet ladies, good night, good night." It is taken directly from <a href="http://tech-two.mit.edu/Shakespeare/Tragedy/hamlet/hamlet.4.5.html"><i>Hamlet</i>
4.5</a>.111-112. This is Ophelia's line, spoken at the height of her madness,
not long before her death.&nbsp; It is not her final exit, but the scene
makes clear that due to the murder of her father by her lover she is no
longer in complete possession of her sanity.&nbsp; What does Eliot mean
to do by using these exact words?&nbsp; I doubt that he thought them merely
to be suitably poetic for his purposes. Then, if not only using the line
for the sake of using a well known line in a well known story, what does
he mean to do?&nbsp; Does he wish to call to the reader's mind the plot
of <i><a href="http://tech-two.mit.edu/Shakespeare/Tragedy/hamlet/hamlet.html">Hamlet</a></i>,
that specific scene, Ophelia's betrayal by her lover, or possibly everything
that Ophelia has come to embody after centuries of analysis?&nbsp; By this,
I am referring to the number of interpretations various critics have applied
to her throughout the centuries, including that of post-modern feminist
symbol (how many recent books or songs written by women have used "Ophelia"
in their title?).&nbsp; Taken as the ending of a section of the poem largely
dedicated to the futility and sterility of love, both of the high and of
the low (a theme reoccurring throughout), it can be seen as an emphatic
conclusion.&nbsp; Another look may reveal it as supporting the theme of
women driven across the normal lines of existence as a result of love.&nbsp;
A third interpretation may focus on the oppression of women by those who
are supposed to love them.&nbsp; Here we see one of the dangers of interpreting
poetry written over seventy years ago.&nbsp; We may be inclined to bring
in the most recent ideas on subjects Eliot alludes to, but in doing so
we risk distorting his intent.&nbsp; How likely is it that the elitist
Eliot, whose misogyny is all too often strikingly clear, was using the
feminist's version of Ophelia to make a statement about the condition of
women?&nbsp; By using a line from <i><a href="http://tech-two.mit.edu/Shakespeare/Tragedy/hamlet/hamlet.html">Hamlet</a></i>,
it seems to me that Eliot has added another dimension to his poem and called
to mind a host of other ideas through just a few lines.
