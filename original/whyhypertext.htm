<h1>
<font size=+1>Why Hypertext?</font></h1>
Hypertext is a means of joining pieces of a data (text, pictures, sound,
movies, or anything else that can be digitally represented) by links, thereby
connecting related pieces of information to one another.&nbsp; Originally,
in choosing to use the format for this project, I was looking for a way
to write differently; at least differently than every paper I have written
since high school.&nbsp; It also occurred to me that the format could work
well for dealing with the topic I wished to explore: literary allusions,
specifically those in T.S. Eliot's poetry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Allusions inherently
have hypertextual character in that an allusions ties one author's work
to that of another.&nbsp; I was also curious as to how the use of hypertext
and related modern technology (computers and the internet) can and has
changed the study of allusions. As Eliot was a poet who addressed the changes
in his modern world through his poetic imagery, I wished to address changes
in our modern world that effect they ways in which we can now study that
same poetry.
<p>Eliot's chaotic use of imagery (as well as the general concept of modernism)
is often seen as a reaction to the creation of modern mass culture.&nbsp;
It is ironic that the mass culture of the 90s, which is even more widespread
and powerful than Eliot's, largely through the creation, increasing power,
and breadth of the internet, can provide the resources to delve into his
obscurities.&nbsp; The references he cryptically interwove may now be tracked
down and traced to their sources, the sources themselves decrypted and
analyzed, and all of that information compiled in a new way with new technology.
We have the opportunity to make the study of Eliot and other such authors
more accessible than ever before by bringing together in one place his
poems, the works he draws upon, works that draw upon him, and the endless
amounts of scholarly criticism that have sprung up around each.&nbsp; Not
only is this a study of one poet's allusions, but it is also becoming one
of the ways in which we now receive information.&nbsp; This has the potential
change to scholarship drastically, and in fact, has already begun to do
so. More resources are more easily available than ever before, as are easy
ways in which to exchange ideas and opinions.&nbsp; This in turn brings
up ideas of intellectual property rights and well as other questions more
likely to bother lawyers than scholars.&nbsp; Then there are the academic
question of the proper way to approach works written before the information
age.&nbsp; If the author did not intend or even conceptualize such technology
enhanced readings, are they valid ways to approach the work?
<p>I feel that not only are such methodologies are valid, but that ignoring
them entirely would be a mistake.&nbsp; It is impossible for us to study
a poet such as Eliot in his own time with the same education and literary
background that he had.&nbsp; Instead, we should make the most of the resources
which we have at hand and of the different (though not radically) ways
of thinking that such resources have created.&nbsp; At the same time we
must be wary of the information at our fingertips.&nbsp; There is now so
much available that one person could never hope to take in the contents
of every scholarly article on the topic at hand.&nbsp; It is also increasingly
easy for incorrect data or bad analyses to join the mixture.&nbsp; Despite
these dangers, the medium has too much potential and too many possible
advantages to be ignored.
<p>In his <i><a href="Bibliography.htm">Hypertext
2.0</a></i> (The first chapter of the book's first edition,
<i>Hypertext:
the Convergence of Contemporary Critical Theory and Technology</i> is available
at <a href="http://landow.stg.brown.edu/ht/contents.html">http://landow.stg.brown.edu/ht/contents.html</a>,
the second edition is suffixed 2.0 in the manner of differentiating between
different versions of software [HV: Sorry, link is now broken.  Apr 2001]), George Landow sees hypertext as a democratizing
force, a way to improve scholarship, a way to attain new levels of cooperation
during the writing process, and an entirely new form of the text that can
continue to change long after the author has finished typing the original
words.<sup><font size=-2><a href="Footnotes.htm#whyhypertextone">1</a></font></sup>&nbsp;
As this is a major work in the field, and representative of other similar
theses, I am going to address some his purported benefits of hypertext,
several of which I agree with, but I will also deal with areas in which
his claims are excessive. He sees hypertext as improving scholarship by
the production of documents that allow the teacher or student to instantly
access additional information on the subject at hand.&nbsp; He also believes
that hypertext will benefit the scholar as a reader - in that footnotes
and side notes can be easily traced with a simple click and without the
necessity of flipping pages or going astray from the <a href="Quotes.htm#landowbasicexperience">main
text</a>.
<p>Landow also discusses the topics of allusion and intertextuality such
as relates to my topic.&nbsp; He uses one of Eliot's contemporaries, James
Joyce to build an <a href="Quotes.htm#LandowJoyce">example</a>
based around Joyce's <i><a href="http://www.bibliomania.com/Fiction/joyce/ulysses/">Ulysses</a></i>,
another text well known for its confusing nature and widespread use of
allusions.&nbsp; He views such works as already being implicitly hypertextual
in that they intentionally draw the reader to other materials that are,
or can be treated as, texts.&nbsp; While I would not go so far as too say
that Eliot and Joyce were intentionally writing hypertextual works, it
easily follows that their works are well suited to a hypertextual presentation.&nbsp;
Landow's suggestion as to how a hypertext presentation of Joyce's novel
might be accomplished, including biographical information, critical commentary,
and variations of the text, could potentially be an ideal, all inclusive
presentation.
<p>Here difficulties arise in the scope Landow seems to be suggesting.
The major problems with producing such a document, at least as I see them,
would largely consist of the legal and technical difficulties of getting
all of the possible source materials into the proper electronic format,
plus the labor necessary to construct such a comprehensive document. An
entirely comprehensive work may be currently impractical, but it easy to
see how including even a fraction of the possible sources or facts through
such linking methods can vastly increase the amount of knowledge (and therefore,
at least theoretically, understanding) passed to the reader.&nbsp; Additionally,
Landow seems to be suggesting that every link to every page a reader could
possibly follow from this paper to any other document would be included
within the definition of what the original document (in this case, this
very paper) consisted of.&nbsp; I do not agree with anything of the sort.&nbsp;
I may have visited a lot of web pages while doing research for this project,
but I do not feel that the sites together make up one coherent document
of any sort. Nor do I include any of the external sites I link to in my
description of this document.&nbsp; They are intended as farther references,
but should not be thought of as part of this project.
<p>There are other senses in which Landow and his fellow proponents of
hypertext seem to go too far.&nbsp; One is in their seeming claim that
hypertext is an entirely new and unique format, as revolutionary as the
printing press.&nbsp; They speak of the words of a hypertext document not
as concrete marks on the page but as far more ephemeral, unstable, and
inherently ever changing.&nbsp; What they seem to neglect is the fact that
their words are stored securely and concretely within their computer system,
just as 1's and 0's instead of letters printed on a piece of paper.&nbsp;
And yes, the electronic version is easier to change, but it's just as plausible
that changes can be made upon the page and/or a new version of the page
including the changes produced.&nbsp; Richard Grusin addresses this, along
with several other problems with the ways Landow and others are pushing
hypertext in his essay <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/configurations/v002/2.3grusin.html">"What
is an Electronic Author? Theory and Technological Fallacy"</a> [HV: Sorry,
can only view this page if your or your institution is subscribed to
Project Muse].&nbsp; As
the title suggests, he looks at some of the issues involved in hypertext
within the context and with the terminology of Michel Foucault's "What
is an author?" essay.&nbsp; He sees that what is most important about electronic
writing is "not its immateriality but rather its power to marshal such
a diversity of material, cultural, and technological forces"<sup><font size=-2><a href="Footnotes.htm#whyhypertexttwo">2</a></font></sup>.
<p>That said, I wish to return to the topic of exploring the use of hypertext
specifically to explore <a href="Allusions.htm">allusions</a>.
On a technical level it allows me to create a hypertext version of the
poem I am examining, <a href="Poem.htm">"The
Hollow Men"</a>, in which words, phrases, or lines of the poem link to
a separate document that annotates the allusion's original source and analyzes
its use.&nbsp; Additionally, I can link to related discussions within my
own project, quotes from the source, the full text of the original source
(when freely available), and as much other related material as I can find.&nbsp;
Hopefully, this has allowed me to include more information and present
it in a more comprehensive way than I would be able to otherwise.&nbsp;
I'm attempting to take advantage of these benefits, but not radically change
the nature of this, a critical paper.&nbsp; Almost everything within this
document should be coherent on its own.&nbsp; The use of hypertext should
merely add to its effectiveness, but it should not rely on hypertext to
be effective.
<p>The one major portion of this project where that may not necessarily
apply is my hypertext version of <a href="Poem.htm">"The
Hollow Men"</a>.&nbsp; The notes I have created to correspond to certain
pieces of the poem do not exactly resemble an essay or typical analysis,
per se.&nbsp; Nor are they flat out annotations, but instead they are a
combination of annotation and analysis.&nbsp; While this may not make for
very good reading by itself, it should work almost as well when read alongside
a paper copy of the poem as when the hypertext links are used.&nbsp; The
advantage of the hypertext version is in the ease of making the connection
from poem to source and/or analysis, plus in the creation of additional
external links that demonstrate farther connections and make farther resources
available.
<p>The study of a poem that incorporates allusions requires a knowing reader,
or least a reader with a willingness to know, while the use of a hypertext
document requires an active reader.&nbsp; By active reader, I mean one
who is willing to follow the connections with which s/he is presented.&nbsp;
This requires neither previous knowledge nor excessive effort.&nbsp; For
a reader of a traditional text who is not inherently knowing (that is to
say that he or she does not recognize and understand the allusion on his
or her own), action is also required.&nbsp; In fact, if the research is
carried out the 'old fashioned way' that action acquires far more effort
that the actions of an active hypertext reader.&nbsp; While hypertext may
not be a radically new and different textual form, it does at least extend
the possibility for a reader to actively learn more about what s/he is
reading.&nbsp; It allows an active reader to become a knowing reader, while
requiring a minimum of unnecessary effort to do so.
