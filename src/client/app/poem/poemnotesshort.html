            <h3>Title</h3>

            <p>Eliot claimed to have made up the title, "The Hollow Men" from
                combining "The Hollow Land", the title of a romance by William Morris with
                Kipling's title, "The Broken Men".&nbsp; Many scholars believe this to
                be one of Ol' Possum's many false trails, instead believing it comes from
                a mention of '<a href="Quotes.htm#JCIVii">hollow
                    men</a>' in <i>Julius Caesar </i>or any of several references to Joseph
                Conrad's Kurtz as hollow in some way (a 'hollow sham', 'hollow at the core').&nbsp;
                The title immediately presents us with the first of many allusions, directly
                referencing two of the four main sources for this poem, Shakespeare's <i><a href="#juliuscaesar">Julius
                    Caesar</a>,</i> and Conrad's <i><a href="#heartofdarkness">Heart of Darkness</a></i>
                (which I will often abbreviate <i>HoD</i>).&nbsp; The other sources are
                the <a href="#gunpowderplot">Gunpowder Plot</a> and <i><a href="#divinecomedy">The
                    Divine Comedy</a></i>, both of which also deal with men or shadows of men
                who may be described as hollow at the core.

            <h3>Gunpowder Plot</h3>

            <p><a href="http://www.gunpowder-plot.org">The Gunpowder Plot</a>: This
                conspiracy arose from the English Catholics' resentment of King James I
                and his reign's treatment of their religion.&nbsp; A group of extremists
                led by Rober Catesby planed to seize power by killing King James I and
                his ministers at the State Opening of Parliament (November 5, 1605), leaving
                England without a government. Francis Tresham, one of the conspirators,
                gave the plan away when he wrote to his brother-in-law, Lord Monteagle,
                telling him to stay away from the Houses of Parliament during the Opening.&nbsp;
                Monteagle informed the Lord Chancellor of the warning, who in turn told
                the king.&nbsp; On November 4, 1605, Guy Fawkes was arrested in the cellars
                of the House of Lords, standing guard over two tons of gunpowder.&nbsp;
                He was tortured until he revealed the names of his co-conspirators, who,
                if they hadn't yet fled the country, were soon executed. Now the British
                celebrate November 5 with bonfires, fireworks, and by burning effigies
                of Guy.&nbsp; Theoretically, they are celebrating the execution of a traitor,
                though some have been been known to see it as a celebration of the near
                death of the monarchy.

            <h3>Julius Caesar</h3>

            <p><i><a href="http://tech-two.mit.edu/Shakespeare/julius_caesar/index.html">Julius
                Caesar</a></i>: Shakespeare's version of the <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/caesar.html">story
                of Julius Caesar</a> also centers around a violent conspiracy of men who
                are blinded by their cause. In it, Brutus, a leading Roman citizen, is
                approached by Cassius, who is recruiting people to conspire to assassinate
                Caesar.&nbsp; Cassius is motivated by ambition, envy, and malice, and he
                persuades Brutus that Caesar is a tyrant who will destroy the Roman Republic.&nbsp;
                Cassius plays on Brutus's vanity of his fame as champion for the public
                good, blinding Brutus to the evil nature of the conspiracy.
